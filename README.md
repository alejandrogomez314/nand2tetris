# nand2Tetris
This project contains my work as well as tools I used to complete the course, "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris." Project work is under `/projects.` Capstone projects are added as folders under root. Instructions on how to run each project are in their respective folder.

This was a really fun course to do, and it helped me understand the first principles that dictate how a computer works in a very practical way. 

Some of the things implemented here are:
- Boolean logic gates
- 16-bit ALU
- Memory
- Assembler
- A stack machine
- 16-bit custom instruction set with basic op codes
- A small operating system
- A statically typed programming language

and more!
